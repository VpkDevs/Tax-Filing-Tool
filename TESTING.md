# Testing the Tax Filing Tool

This document provides instructions on how to run the automated tests for the Tax Filing Tool.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

## Installing Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install Jest and other testing dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Tests

To run all tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode (tests will automatically re-run when files change):

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

The coverage report will be available in the `coverage` directory.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized as follows:

- `tests/js/autoFillOptions.test.js`: Tests for the auto-fill options functionality
- `tests/js/navigation.test.js`: Tests for the navigation functionality
- `tests/js/claimProcessTracker.test.js`: Tests for the claim process tracker
- `tests/js/taxFilingApp.test.js`: Tests for the main tax filing app functionality

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests:

1. Create a new test file in the `tests/js` directory
2. Import the necessary modules and mock any dependencies
3. Write your test cases using Jest's testing functions
4. Run the tests to make sure they pass

## Mocking

The tests use Jest's mocking capabilities to mock DOM elements and functions. The mocks are set up in the `tests/js/setup.js` file, which is loaded before running the tests.

## Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that changes to the codebase don't break existing functionality.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues running the tests:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Check that the test files are in the correct location
3. Verify that the code being tested is accessible from the test files
4. Check for any syntax errors in the test files

If you still have issues, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
