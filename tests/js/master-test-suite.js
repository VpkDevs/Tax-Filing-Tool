 * 
 * Following a true TDD approach, these tests define the desired behavior
 * and serve as both specification and verification.

/**
 * This master test suite organizes tests into logical categories:
 * 
 * 1. UI Tests: Focus on user interface components and interactions
 * 2. Core Tests: Focus on core functionality and business logic
 * 3. Feature Tests: Focus on specific features and user workflows
 * 4. Integration Tests: Focus on how components work together
 * 
 * Each test suite defines the expected behavior for its respective area,
 * serving as a specification for how the application OUGHT to function.
 * 
 * The implementation should be modified to meet these specifications,
 * ensuring a high-quality, feature-rich application.
